# UI5 MDC Tutorial 
[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-mdc-json-tutorial)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-mdc-json-tutorial)
## Description
In this tutorial, we will cover some key concepts involving metadata-driven controls (MDCs). This includes understanding control delegates, PropertyInfo, Table, Filter Bar, Value Help, TypeMap, and variant management. The implementation will be based on a JSON model and is based on our official [Demokit Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.mdc/sample/sap.ui.mdc.demokit.sample.TableFilterBarJson). After completion, you should be able to leverage the full potential of the MDC concepts in your own projects.
>‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The sap.ui.mdc library is still experimental API and we expect some (but not many) changes for the generally available version with UI5 2.0. üß™
### Metadata-Driven Controls
Metadata-Driven Controls or MDCs are a powerful tool that allows you to create user interfaces dynamically at runtime. The controls are driven by metadata, which gives a description of the data and its characteristics. This way, you don't have to explicitly define every control in your UI, but you can configure and modify them based on the provided metadata. Find more details in the UI5 [Documentation](https://sdk.openui5.org/topic/1dd2aa91115d43409452a271d11be95b) and [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.mdc).
### Delegates
Control Delegates are used to implement service or application-specific behavior in your MDCs. They allow developers to customize the default behavior of controls depending on the specific needs of their service or application. This can include things like custom control creation, metadata provision, or data binding.
### PropertyInfo
PropertyInfo is used to define the necessary metadata that should be provided to the controls. This can include information like the control visibility, the data type, or other control-specific settings. PropertyInfo is essential in letting your MDCs know how they should behave.
### Used Controls
These are some specific types of MDCs that you can use in your applications:
- **Table**: This control lets you display data in a tabular format. You can define columns and rows based on the provided metadata.
- **Filter Bar**: This control provides a user interface for creating complex filter conditions. It can be used in conjunction with a Table control to filter the displayed data.
- **Value Help**: This control is used to assist the user in inputting data. It can provide suggestions or a list of possible values to choose from based on the provided metadata.
### Custom Types
The TypeMap is used for defining custom types in your MDCs. If the standard types provided are not sufficient for your needs, you can add your own using the TypeMap. This gives you even more flexibility in customizing your controls.
### Variant Management and Personalization
Variant Management is a feature that allows users to save their personalization settings. This can include things like the layout of a table, filter conditions in a filter bar, or others. These settings can then be loaded later, allowing users to customize their experience and increase their productivity.
